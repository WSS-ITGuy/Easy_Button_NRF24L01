# Easy Button NRF24L01 Button
### Note: I have had a button like this sitting on my desk for 2years now and it still works just fine, it only gets used once a month or so.

## Arduino Model
Many models are an option but this guide will use the arduino pro mini as they are cheap and plentiful, you will want a 3.3v Version running at 8mhz.

For Ultra low power you will need to remove the LED and regulator, if you are lucky enough to have a board with the regulator "Strap" likethis sparkfun model. You can just remove the solder bridge to disable the regulator.
